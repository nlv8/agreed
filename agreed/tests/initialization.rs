/// - brings 3 nodes online with only knowledge of themselves.
/// - asserts that they remain in non-voter state with no activity (they should be completely passive).

/// - asserts that the cluster was able to come online, elect a leader and maintain a stable state.
/// - asserts that the leader was able to successfully commit its initial payload and that all
///   followers have successfully replicated the payload.
