Rust is an outstanding language for building stateful systems.

- We don't need to continue allocating all of the memory of all of the clouds to the JVM.
- We ABSOLUTELY need to move away from all of the memory safety issues which have compromised countless systems.
- Raft is a robust and powerful consensus protocol, and this implementation offers a fairly robust API to build against.

There are plenty of awesome things to build! Let's do this!
