Agreed is an implementation of the [Raft](https://raft.github.io) consensus protocol in Rust, intented to serve as a basis for distributed data systems.

**Getting Started**

If you want to get started with building applications on top of Agreed, then checkout out [The Agreed Guide](https://nlv8.github.io/agreed). Afterwards, feel free to jump into [the documentation](https://docs.rs/agreed/latest/agreed/).

## Features

  * Fully asynchronous, built on top of [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/).
  * Pluggable storage and network layer.
  * Log compaction with snapshots and snapshot streaming.
  * Fully pipelined and batched log replication with congestion control.
  * Single-node cluster membership change operations.
  * Non-Voter nodes for data replication/change data capture.
  * Instrumented with [tracing](https://docs.rs/tracing/).
